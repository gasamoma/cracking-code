Problem and code
A ransom note can be formed by cutting words out of a magazine to form a new sentence. How would you figure out if a ransom note (represented as a string) can be formed from a given magazine (string)? 
Example
Note ->Some ransom note
Magazine->The magazine contains some words that some of them are repeated notes, others are random or ransom, nevertheless, this is funny
Supposing no comas
Brute Force n*m*k
def ransom(note, magazine):
	splitted_note = note.split(“ ”)
	splitted_magazine = magazine.split(“ ”)
	for word in splitted_note:
		found =false
		for maga in splitted_magazine:
			If word == maga:
				splitted_magazine.remove(maga)
found= true
				Break
		If not found :
			return false
	Return true
Optimize k*(n+m)
def ransom(note, magazine):
	splitted_note = note.split(“ ”)
	splitted_mag = magazine.split(“ ”)
count_mag =dict.fromkeys(splitted_mag, 0)
count_note =dict.fromkeys(splitted_note , 0)
	for maga in splitted_mag:
		count_mag[maga]+=1
	
	for word in splitted_note :
		If count_mag[word]>0:
			count_mag[word]-=1
		Else:
			Return false
	Return true
